Improve your skills by tackling a new Postman challenge for 30 days in a row.

### How it works

1. **Get the daily challenge**: Fork the parent collection for each day to your own public Postman workspace.
1. **Review the instructions**: Read the corresponding collection documentation for instructions on how to complete each challenge. Additional resources are available if you want to dive deeper into any of the topics.
1. **Check your solutions**: When you think you've got it, validate your solution by following the instructions in the `Submit your solution` folder. For the first 29 days, you will be checking your own work.

### Prerequisites

1. **Sign in to Postman:** Create a Postman account if you don't have one already, and log into [Postman for the web](https://go.postman.co) in your browser. To use Postman in a web browser, download and run the [Postman agent](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your local machine to overcome cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. The agent is not the same as the app. On a Mac, you will see an icon for the Postman agent running in the status menu at the top right of your computer screen. On a Windows machine, the Postman agent icon displays in the system tray at the bottom right of your computer screen.
1. **Create a public workspace**: [Create a new Postman workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace) with visibility set to `Public` to show your work. Every day, fork a new challenge from [the parent workspace](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/overview) to your own, and work through the day's challenge. Change the name of your public workspace to deter others from directly copying your answers.

> If you don't want to use Postman in a web browser with the agent, you can instead download and install the Postman app for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

### What You’ll Learn

- Basic development skills like how to send and authorize API requests
- Higher-level development skills like using variables, tests, and scripts
- Advanced development skills like visualizing data and generating dynamic requests

### What You’ll Build

- A public Postman workspace with collections, monitors, mock servers, code samples, and more.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **How long does it take to complete the 30 days of Postman challenge?** Plan to spend 5 to 45 minutes every day to explore the topic and dive deeper into the topics you find interesting. Go at your own pace. There is no penalty for taking longer. **Note**: if a very long period of time elapses from when you fork a challenge to when you submit the final solution, you may need to pull the latest changes to ensure the solution you submit is up to date.
- **Do I need to complete all 30 challenges?** You are welcome to dive into any of the topics that you find interesting. However, some challenges build on concepts introduced in earlier challenges. So you will receive less guidance for concepts covered earlier in the series.
- **I am new to code.** Is this challenge for me? The challenges are designed for developers and suitable for novice developers. If you know basic software programming concepts and beginner JavaScript (or some other programming language), this challenge is for you. If you're an API professional, but don't identify as a developer, you may need to do extra research to complete some challenges.
- **I'm stuck. Can someone please help?**
  - Re-read the instructions carefully, and check out the documentation and additional resources listed in the instructions.
  - Try submitting an incomplete solution locally to reveal clues in the test results.
  - Look for similar examples in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/). If you're asking for help, make sure to include a thorough explanation of your question, what you've tried already, and include a direct link to your own public workspace so others can see where you're stuck.
