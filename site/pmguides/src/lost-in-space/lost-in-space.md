### How it works [🛰️](https://4d0c1c01-a3d2-45f5-bf3c-4361da46203f.mock.pstmn.io/hints)

1. **Get instructions**: Fork the [**Read Me First**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/lost-in-space/collection/1559645-d0f86bd4-ba8d-4876-8161-9b3361de1351) collection to your own workspace. Share your work in a [team or public workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-new-workspace) so others can review issues.
2. **Review mission**: Send the API call in the collection for instructions on how to collect the clues.
3. **Submit final solution**: When you think you've gathered all the data, validate your solution by providing the required information to [**Mission Control**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/lost-in-space/collection/1559645-4bc6b58a-3462-4e0a-ba10-79bc68761a9b?ctx=documentation).

### Prerequisites

1. **Sign in to Postman:** Create a Postman account if you don't have one already, and log into [Postman for the web](https://go.postman.co) in your browser. To use Postman in a web browser, download and run the [Postman agent](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your local machine to overcome cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) limitations. The agent is not the same as the app. On a Mac, you will see an icon for the Postman agent running in the status menu at the top right of your computer screen. On a Windows machine, the Postman agent icon displays in the system tray at the bottom right of your computer screen.
1. **Create a workspace**: [Create a new Postman workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace) with visibility set to `Team` if you are collaborating with teammates.

> If you don't want to use Postman in a web browser with the agent, you can instead download and install the Postman app for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

### What You’ll Learn

> This challenge is not intended to be a comprehensive or structured learning experience. It's possible that you acquire some technical skills. But the primary purpose of this challenge is for fun, if you like this kind of thing.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **How long does it take to complete the Lost in Space mission?** Plan to spend 2 to 4 hours or longer. Go at your own pace. There is no penalty for taking longer, collaborating with teammates, or taking a break and returning to try again. It is **highly encouraged** to form a team, since everyone's brain works differently and humans can accomplish more together than individually.
- **I am new to code and APIs. Is this challenge for me?** Some of the puzzles are designed for developers and suitable for novice developers. If you know basic web API concepts and beginner JavaScript, you are in good shape. If you're an API professional, but don't identify as a developer, you may need to do extra research to complete some steps. Or invite a coding buddy to join your team.
- **I am not a native English speaker. Is this challenge for me?** Some of the puzzles are extremely challenging if you are not a native English speaker, or are visually-impaired or hearing-impaired. It is highly encouraged to form a team with diverse capabilities and perspectives.
- **Can I search the Internet?** Yes. Use any available resources to solve the puzzles.
- **I'm stuck. Can someone please help?**

- Re-read the instructions carefully for hints.
- If your question is about APIs or Postman, look in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/). If you're asking for help, make sure to include a thorough explanation of your question, what you've tried already, and include a direct link to your own public workspace so others can see where you're stuck.
- If your question is related to the rules of the game (e.g. not a technical Postman question), you can ask for guidance in the [Training](https://community.postman.com/c/training/38) section of the community forum.
